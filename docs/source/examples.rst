Examples
========

Welcome to the Pisces example gallery. On this page, there are a number of compiled guides and example scripts showing
how to use various aspects of the Pisces codebase.

Getting Started
---------------

.. card-carousel:: 2

    .. card:: Quickstart: Spherical Galaxy Cluster Model
        :link: examples/galaxy_cluster_spherical
        :link-type: doc

        This quickstart guide will show you how to build a very simple model of a galaxy cluster
        using Pisces. Galaxy cluster models can then used to build initial conditions and other
        useful structures for various scientific tasks.

Science Workflows
-----------------

.. card-carousel:: 2

    .. card:: Mock X-ray Observations of Galaxy Clusters (Spherical)
        :link: examples/pyxsim_spherical
        :link-type: doc

        This guide will show how to integrate Pisces with ``pyxsim`` to generate mock x-ray
        observations of galaxy clusters.
