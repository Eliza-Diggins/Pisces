Pisces User Guide
=================

Some areas of the ``Pisces`` code are quite complex and rely heavily on complicated ideas from
astrophysics, mathematics, and numerical methods. To make the use of the code as
straight-forward as possible, we've provided a **User-Guide** for those interested in learning
about particular aspects of the code. Resources in this section range from complex notes about
the Pisces backend to basic physics overviews of specific types of systems.
