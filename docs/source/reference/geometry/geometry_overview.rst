Geometry Overview
=================

One of the cornerstone features of Pisces is its ability to support complicated processes in many generic coordinate systems.
On this page, and the linked sub-pages, you'll find a detailed accounting of the theory and implementation behind our coordinate
systems and what they can be used for.

Theory
------

Arbitrary coordinate systems are a complex subject unto themselves and require a relatively sophisticated understanding
of the relevant mathematics to fully digest. For readers who are not familiar with the theory of orthogonal coordinate systems,
including the use of Lame coefficients and the construction of differential operators, we suggest reading the documentation
provided on :ref:`geometry_theory` to get an overview of the relevant background.

Implementation
