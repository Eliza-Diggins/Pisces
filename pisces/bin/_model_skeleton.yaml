#   This is a template configuration file for developers to modify when generating custom configurations for new       #
#   models. Developers are recommended to copy the template in order to ensure the continuation of built-in functions  #
#   which reference the configuration of the model in which they are defined. Alternatively, developers can overwrite  #
#   these methods as needed.                                                                                           #

fields:
  # The `fields` element of the configuration dictionary should hold an entry for each of the standard fields of the
  # model. This doesn't prevent other fields from being added to a model, but does provide a default repository for
  # methods looking for default units, symbols, and field relationships.
  #
  # By default, the fields have the `units` attribute only, which specifies the standard units to convert to when
  # generating fields on disk.
